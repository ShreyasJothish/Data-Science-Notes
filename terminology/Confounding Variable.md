In an experiment, the **independent variable** typically has an effect on your **dependent variable**. For example, if you are researching whether lack of exercise leads to weight gain, lack of exercise is your independent variable and weight gain is your dependent variable. **Confounding variables** are any other variable that also has an effect on your dependent variable. They are like extra independent variables that are having a hidden effect on your dependent variables.

Normally in experiemnt, independent variable(s) are used to check the effect on dependent variable. **Extraneous variables** are additional variables which may or may not interfere with validity of this experiment. If any of these extraneous variables does interfere with validity of experiment, then those are called **Confounding variables**.
